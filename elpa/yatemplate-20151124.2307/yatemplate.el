;;; Commentary:

;; This package bridges the gap between yasnippet and auto-insert-mode. By
;; populating auto-insert-alist with filenames and automatically expanding their
;; content after insertion by auto-insert-mode, it's an easy way to create
;; dynamic file templates. Simply call `yatemplate-fill-alist' somewhere in your
;; Emacs initialization file to populate `auto-insert-alist' with filenames from
;; `yatemplate-dir'.

;; Each filename will be turned into a new element to `push' onto
;; `auto-insert-alist'. To guarantee a particular order, filenames must contain
;; one colon (":"). After collecting all the filenames in `yatemplate-dir',
;; their names will be sorted with `string<', then split on the colon. The first
;; substring will be discarded, which means it can be used to establish an
;; ordering. The second substring will be used as a regexp as the CONDITION of
;; the element to push onto `auto-insert-alist'. The ACTION will be a vector of
;; actions that first insert the content of the template file and then expand
;; the content of the buffer with `yatemplate-expand-yas-buffer', which simply
;; calls `yas-expand-snippet', so you can use everything YASnippet offers in
;; the template.

;; This means that if `yatemplate-dir' looks like this:

;; .emacs.d/templates
;; ├── 00:test_.*.py
;; └── 01:.*.py

;; `yatemplate-fill-alist' will first `push' (".*.py" . ACTION) onto
;; `auto-insert-alist' and then ("test_.*.py" . ACTION).

;; Of course, you will need to enable `auto-insert-mode' to have the snippet
;; inserted and expanded into new files.
