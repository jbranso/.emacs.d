;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs' Info manuals are extremely rich in content, but the user
;; experience isn't all that it could be; an Emacs process contains a
;; lot of information about the same things that Info manuals
;; describe, but vanilla Info mode doesn't really do much to take
;; advantage of that.  Niceify-info remedies this.

;; To improve a single Info page, do M-x niceify-info in that page's
;; buffer.  If you decide you like the effect so much that you want it
;; applied to all Info pages you visit, add the `niceify-info'
;; function to `Info-selection-hook' in your init file.  For example:

;;     (add-hook 'Info-selection-hook #'niceify-info)

;; This function applies a set of changes I call "niceification",
;; because I have a longstanding fondness for terrible names.  This
;; process does the following things:

;; - Applies customizable faces to text surrounded by emphasis
;;   characters * and _.  The default faces for these are bold and
;;   italic, respectively, because that's what the GNU-hosted HTML
;;   versions of the Emacs manuals use, but they can be customized to
;;   suit your taste.

;; - Identifies Emacs Lisp code samples and fontifies them
;;   accordingly.

;; - Identifies references in `ticks', and where they refer to
;;   function or variable bindings, applies the necessary text
;;   properties to link them to the relevant documentation.  References
;;   without a corresponding function or variable binding will be
;;   fontified as Emacs Lisp, by the same method used for code
;;   samples.

;; - Identifies headers for longer-form documentation of several types
;;   of objects, such as: "-- Function: find-file filename &optional
;;   wildcards" and applies text properties making them easier to
;;   identify and parse.  Names for documented things are linked to
;;   their documentation in the same way as for references in
;;   `ticks'.  Functions' argument lists are additionally fontified
;;   with a customizable face, which defaults to italic.

;; Each kind of niceification has a corresponding customization option
;; to enable or disable it.  You can easily access these via M-x
;; customize-group RET niceify-info RET, or as a subgroup of the Info
;; customization group.  The faces used for emphases, and for function
;; argument lists in headers, can also be customized.

;;; Bugs:

;; Little of this is done with perfect accuracy.  Here are the known
;; issues:

;; - Autoloaded libraries not currently loaded will not have
;;   references in `ticks' linked or fontified.  (But if you load such
;;   a library, and then revisit an Info page containing such
;;   references, they will be correctly niceified.)

;; - Code sample identification and fontification is questionable.  Due
;;   to the lack of structural information in Texinfo files, the only
;;   reliable method I've found of identifying a code sample is by
;;   looking for places where indentation is deeper than the usual for
;;   paragraphs on this page, and checking to see whether the first
;;   following non-whitespace character is '(' or ';'.  This will fail
;;   on Emacs Lisp forms which do not start with those characters, and
;;   will have unpredictable and probably ugly results on code samples
;;   not actually in Emacs Lisp which happen to start with one of
;;   those characters.

;;   The former issue I've found to be negligible, since it only
;;   appears to affect printable forms of non-printable objects
;;   (e.g. buffers, hash tables) which wouldn't be affected by
;;   fontification anyway.

;;   The latter issue I actually have yet to run across; in the
;;   non-Emacs-related Texinfo manuals I have on the systems where I
;;   wrote and tested this code, an admittedly brief and unsystematic
;;   search has failed to turn up any code samples or other quotes
;;   which erroneously trigger fontification.  If you find one, let me
;;   hear about it! (See below for details on how.)

;; - For symbols with both a function and a variable binding, the
;;   function binding is always preferred.  This seems to be a fairly
;;   rare case, and handling it (by prompting for which binding's
;;   documentation to display) is surprisingly complex, so I plan to
;;   leave it for a later version of the library.  If you're anxious to
;;   have it before I get around to implementing it, feel free to open
;;   a pull request!

;; - Not all kinds of headers in Info pages are niceified, because for
;;   a lot of them I couldn't figure out how to do anything useful.

;;; Contributing:

;; I welcome bug reports, feature requests, and proposed
;; modifications. You can submit all of these via Github's issue and
;; pull request trackers at
;; https://github.com/aaron-em/niceify-info.el, and that is the method
;; I prefer. Should you prefer not to use Github, or if the concern
;; you wish to raise doesn't fit well into one of those categories,
;; you can also contact me by email at me@aaron-miller.me.
