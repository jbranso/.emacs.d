;;; Commentary:

;; `easy-escape-minor-mode' composes double backslashes (escape characters) into
;; single backslashes, and highlights them to improve readability.
;;
;; For example, `easy-escape` displays "\\(?:\\_<\\\\newcommand\\_>\\s-*\\)?"
;; as "\(?:\_<\\newcommand\_>\s-*\)?".  The underlying text is not modified.
;;
;; The default it to use a single \ character instead of two, but the character
;; used and its color can be customized using `easy-escape-face' and
;; `easy-escape-character' (which see).
;;
;; Suggested setup:
;;   (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook 'easy-escape-minor-mode)
;; or
;;   (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'easy-escape-minor-mode)
;;
;; NOTE: If you find the distinction between the fontified double-slash and the
;; single slash too subtle, try the following:
;;
;; * Adjust the foreground of `easy-escape-face'
;; * Set `easy-escape-character' to a different character.
