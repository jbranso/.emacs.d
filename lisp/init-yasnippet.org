Set up yasnippet.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq yas-snippet-dirs '("~/.emacs.d/snippets"))
(use-package yasnippet
  :defer t
  :ensure t)
(yas-global-mode 1)
#+END_SRC
;; (diminish 'yas-global-mode)
;; I don't want yas globally on, because emmet mode works better in for html, and css
;; however, if I can change yas-expand key to something other than tab, then I should turn this back on.
;; because then I can have snippets for javascript, jquery, and php!


If I modify the buffer in yasnippet via a back-ticks via ~`SOME ELISP CODE `~, then yasnippet will issue a warning.  Let's tell yasnippet NOT to tell me about that.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'warning-suppress-types '(yasnippet backquote-change))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(provide 'init-yasnippet)
#+END_SRC
