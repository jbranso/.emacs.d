* Combining auto insertion and yasnippet
For a long time now, I've wanted Emacs to auto-insert text into a buffer for me.  I have not been able to get it to work, but thanks to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/4vrz3v/autoinsertmode_is_not_working/][awesome emacs reddit community]], I was able to get it to work.  They also pointed out this rather extensive yasnippet Congration file:  https://github.com/alexott/emacs-configs/blob/master/rc/emacs-rc-auto-insert.el
** Set up yasnippet

Inserting a predefined snippet via Emacs lisp is defined [[http://joaotavora.github.io/yasnippet/snippet-expansion.html#sec-1-6][here]].  In case you don't like reading, then just do the following:

~(yas-expand-snippet (yas-lookup-snippet "SnippetName"))~

I'm defining some functions that will automatically expand when I open a file.  Cool eh?  It will also turn my state into evil-state.  That way I can just start typing.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/yas-org-snippet ()
    (interactive)
    (yas-expand-snippet (yas-lookup-snippet "<org"))
    (evil-insert-state))

  (defun my/yas-elisp-init-files-snippet ()
    (interactive)
    (yas-expand-snippet (yas-lookup-snippet "<elisp-init-files"))
    (evil-insert-state))


  (defun my/cover-letter-file-snippet ()
    (interactive)
    (yas-expand-snippet (yas-lookup-snippet "<cover-letter"))
    (evil-insert-state))

  (defun my/cover-letter-file-snippet ()
    (interactive)
    (yas-expand-snippet (yas-lookup-snippet "<blog-entry"))
    (evil-insert-state))

  (defun my/yas-web-mode-snippet ()
    (interactive)
    (yas-expand-snippet (yas-lookup-snippet "<web-mode"))
    (evil-insert-state))

** Set up autoinsertion
This section configures emacs to [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/autotype/Autoinserting.html][autoinsert text]] into an empty buffer via yasnippets.

Require the autoinsert library.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'autoinsert)
#+END_SRC

When you open up an empty file, perform auto-insertion, if applicable.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'find-file-hook 'auto-insert)
#+END_SRC

Tell Emacs where to look for default text files to insert into empty files.  If you don't want to use yasnippet then you could use this method instead.  But let's be honest, we all like yasnippets, so you really probably don't need this next section of code.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq auto-insert-directory "~/.emacs.d/auto-insert-directory/")
#+END_SRC

Enable autoinsert mode, and do not ask me if I want to perform automatic insertion.  Just do it.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq auto-insert-mode t
        auto-insert-query nil)
#+END_SRC

Auto-insertion of a buffer is completed via the variable =auto-insert-alist=.  If CONDITION is met, then ACTION is done.
=(add-to-list auto-insert-alist '((CONDITION . DESCRIPTION) . ACTION))=
CONDITION may be a regexp that matches the file name or a symbol that matches the major mode.
ACTION may be a function or a filename found in auto-insert-directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq auto-insert-alist '((web-mode . [my/yas-web-mode-snippet])
                            (org-mode . [my/yas-org-snippet])))
#+END_SRC

*** My org-mode files specific templates.
I use org-mode a lot.  And different directories have different formats.  This next bit of code ensures that when I open a file in a specific directory, Emacs inserts a template specific to that directory.

**** My elisp init files template
Much of my Emacs init files, use org-mode. So if I am in my init-file directory, go ahead and open an org file with that predefined snippet.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'auto-insert-alist '((".*/lisp/.*\\.org$") . [my/yas-elisp-init-files-snippet]))
#+END_SRC

**** My cover letter template
I have a directory where I write cover letters.  I want a default snippet to expand whenever I write a cover letter.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'auto-insert-alist '((".*/cover-letters.*\\.org$") . [my/cover-letter-file-snippet]))
#+END_SRC

**** My blog template
I use org-mode for blogging.  It is quite nice to have it auto-insert what needs to be inserted.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'auto-insert-alist '((".*/my-wordpress-blog.*\\.org$") . [my/cover-letter-file-snippet]))
#+END_SRC
** Provide this file
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(provide 'init-autoinsert)
#+END_SRC
