Polymode lets you mix different source code in one file.  This lets me edit org-mode files, w/o having to press "C-c '" all of the time.  [[https://github.com/vspinu/polymode#activation-of-polymodes][You can read more about it here.]]  MMM-mode might be better, BUT polymode seems to be faster.

  (use-package polymode :ensure t
