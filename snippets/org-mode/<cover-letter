Hello $1,

I am a budding web developer interested in working with you to design awesome web content for the web. For the past two years I have worked as a full stack web developer with the responsibility to code elegant and mobile responsive websites that usually required content management systems.  This past year,  I was the lead developer for Waypoint, which is a small web design company based in Lafayette Indiana.  I have acquired a passionate understanding of HTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3, javascript, jQuery, PHP, and MySQL.  Recently I wrote my own WordPress theme for a local business, and the experience left me in awe of WordPress theme and plugin creation.

I expect that working for you will help me grow professionally in a way that few other companies could replicate.  Specifically,  I hope that being a coding your designs into websites will further hone my skills as a talented web developer and will teach me more about solving complicated problems.  I admire your ability to create such elegant designs, and I look forward to hearing from you.
